\#6 steps to understanding the P-value
\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#

\#1 We want to test the probability that makes us believe that an
effect(-15) \# or difference between two groups is NOT happening by
random chance

\#2.We assume the mean effect between these \# groups is zero meaning we
assume that there is no effect

\#3. We run a ttest to get the prob of that effect happening and check
the \# equivalent Probabiltiy. Note that we still assume our mean
difference is zero

\#4.We can say that if that probability we get is 5\% or less, then that
is \# probability of that effect occuring at an assumption of a mean of
zero.

\#5. It means the probability of that effect happening if we set our \#
mean difference to zero is very low. Since the probability that it will
occur is \#is very low, we should not accept that our mean difference is
zero.

\#6. So we reject that our mean difference is zero, and take the
alternative hypothesis.
